# data

**Data for Fig. 4**
The files contain the comma separated data for the experiment in Fig. 4. Each file is one experiment with a total incubation time of 12, 18, 24 and 30 h, respectively.<br>
Columns are:<br>
x coordinate | y coordinate | # of division at the end of experiment | size at 0 h | size at 4 h | size at the end of experiment <br>

Time is in hours of total experimental time. Liquid cultures kept in the dark were plated on solid photo-autotrophic medium at 0 h. Cells were subjected to 4 h of light (0-4h) and shifted into darkness until the end of the experiment, when divisions were scored. Columns 4-6 show the cell area at the indicated time of measurement in pixels. Entries of ‘-1’ mark unreliable size measurement after cell division. <br><br>

**Data for Fig. S4**
The file contains the comma separated data for the experiment in Fig. S4.<br>
Columns are:<br>
coords   |    # of divisions scored at    |          cell sizes at<br>
xID yID     0  6  12  18  24  30  36  48     0  6  12  18  24  30  36  48<br>

Time is in hours of total experimental time. For the scheme and curves in Fig. S4C-E, 6 h were subtracted from this time. Liquid cultures kept under constant illumination were plated on solid photo-autotrophic medium at 0 h. Cells were kept in the dark for 6 h (0-6 h), subjected to 6 h of light (6-12 h) and then kept in the dark for 36 h (0-48 h). Columns 3-10 indicate the number of cell divisions that occurred during the preceding time interval. Columns 11-18 show the cell area at the indicated time of measurement in pixels. Note that size measurements of divided cells are inaccurate. Cells that divided prior to the 12 h sample were disregarded.
